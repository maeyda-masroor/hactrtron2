In this hacktratron i used chatgpt for responsive and design starting of with 5 break point 
Breakpoints are sm , md , lg ,xl ,2xl ... for sm , md i choose 1 col span using grid ... for lg ,xl and 2xl i use 2 cols span .. 3 soon as need 
i used tailwindcss so using tailwindconfig i made colour define choosing from template-4 given by teacher .. 
starting off with Home page .. i made grid keeping padding left and right only so content remain in center . 
where the data seem more than one we use so i use predefined array 
On home page ... using categories ... i made dynamic route to product page containing filteration and product data ... when clicking on some product title it pass the data to detail page 
so category -> product -> product detail 

i used three libraries beside tailwindcss
Star rating library to render star based on dynamic value ...
react - slick for sliding product card when to show products that are more than in page defined .. like if page contains 4 product grid so if user want to add 5 product one will shown on sliding
tab ui with custom style is also used

cart page was created
wishlist 
order completed page 

some of the pages has link in footer while some are linked with top navbar and navbar
